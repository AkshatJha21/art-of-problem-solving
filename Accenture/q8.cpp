// In a competitive gardening contest, 
// participants are provided with a list of plant heights 
// represented as positive numbers in a single-line array, 
// each value separated by spaces. 
// Identify the most significant difference in height between any two plants.
// The challenge is to select a pair of plants, denoted as (i, j). 
// The subtracted value of i and j should be the maximum 
// when compared with different values of i and j in the array, 
// and also the value of j should be greater than the value of i.
// Input :
// 8 // size of array
// 9 10 2 6 7 12 8 1
// Output :
// 5
// Explanation :
// The difference between values 0 and 5 is 5. 
// If i is equal to 0 and j is equal to 5 it also satisfies j > i.
